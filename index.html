          Harry Potter is a 10 year old boy who lives at Privet Drive, along with his horrible aunt, uncle and cousin.
          Life is not very fascinating, as he spends a lot of time in a cupboard. One day, however, he receives a letter from
          <em>Hogwarts</em>: a school for witchcraft and wizardry. Harry's uncle forces him to stay home, until the half-giant <em>Hagrid</em>
          comes to take him personally. Harry appears to be famous in the wizarding world, due to his connection with the evil <em>Lord Voldemort</em>.
          He soon finds out Hogwarts is not just a place with friends...
