      <h1>Film</h1>
      <p>
        The film <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</em> was released
        in 2001. It was directed Chris Columbus and distributed by Warner Bros.
        Pictures. The film became a massive commercial success, grossing $974.8
        million at the box office worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film
        of 2001.
      </p>

      <div class="main__paragraph">
        <h2>Cast</h2>
        <img
          src="./images/actors.jpg"
          alt="Harry Potter actors: Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Ruppert Grint."
          width="220"
          class="film-image align-right"
        />
        <p>
          Among the actors are Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Ruppert Grint
          (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger). At the time of
          shooting the film, they were 11, 12 and 10 respectively. When selling
          the rights for the film, J.K. Rowling urged that the whole cast would
          be British, which the producers of the film agreed with. Other
          noticeable actors are John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Robbie
          Coltrain (Rubeus Hagrid), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Maggie
          Smith (Minerva McGonagall).

      <div class="main__paragraph">
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
          The music was created by the respected composer John Williams, who is
          also known for his work on Jurassic Park, Jaws and Star Wars, among
          others films. Although different composers would replace Williams in
          later films, his composition <em>Hedwig's Theme</em> contains one of
          Hollywood's most memorable melodies, which is used throughout the
          Harry Potter series.

        <h2>Differences from book</h2>
        <p>
          Not all fans of the Philosopher's Stone book are too keen on the movie
          version, mainly because there are differences between the two. A few
          examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Peeves the poltergeist appears in the book, but not in the movie.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the book, Harry's aunt and uncle have blonde hair, whereas in the
            movie they have black hair.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the book, the <em>sorting hat</em> always sings a song before
            sorting new students of Hogwarts in their houses. In the movie, this
            doesn't happen.
          </li>
          <li>
            When looking in the <em>Mirror of Erised</em>, Harry sees his
            parents, grandparents and a lot of others family members. In the
            movie, he only sees his parents.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="main__paragraph">
        <h2>Reception</h2>
        <p>
          The movie was greatly received at the box office. It made $32.3
          million on the opening day, breaking the single day record previously
          held by <em>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Manace</em>. In total,
          it made $90.3 million during the opening weekend, also breaking the
          record of highest-opening weekend of all time, previously held by
          <em>The Lost World: Jurrasic Park</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film received many nominations, including three of the Academy
          Award: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design and Best Origin Score
          for John Williams. It was also nominated for several BAFTA awards and
          many others. The Philosopher's Stone also won a lot of awards,
          including a Saturn Award for costume design, Best Live Action Family
          Film, among others.
